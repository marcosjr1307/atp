There are simples exercises using C language that I need to do for my ATP classes. üßëüèª‚Äçüíª<br>
Even though these are very easy exercises, i will keep this repository public for anyone who needs to see some exercises when they start programming for the first time! ü•á<br>
The exercises range from basic concepts (calculating averages) to more advanced language concepts. üìà
